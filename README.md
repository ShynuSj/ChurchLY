Payment Managment System [ HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Express JS | Passport JS | SQlite 3 ]
I built a web application using ReactJS and ExpressJS frameworks with the help of Material ui library and
database backend to manage the accounting of churches. The primary goal of the application was to
facilitate the tracking of bills and payments, as well as automate the process of updating pending payments
for members.
